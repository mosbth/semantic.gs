The Semantic Grid
========================================

This is a fork of the project "[The Semantic Grid](https://github.com/tylertate/semantic.gs)" created by [@tylertate](https://github.com/tylertate).

The initial project has [not had to much update lately](https://github.com/tylertate/semantic.gs/issues) and it occasionally lost its original website, so I decided to make a fork of it to be able to continue use it.

I use it for own projects and in my education.

[Review the examples](webroot) on a copy of the original website.

Read the original [README.md](old/README.md).



Revision history

v1.4.0 (2016-06-07)

* Not an actual release, just a baseline to start from.
* Added website to show off examples. All examples resides in `webroot`.
* Renamed and rearranged files to separate the actual grid from the examples on how to use it.
